# Courseflow

> *Course evaluation, reimagined.*

A redesigned course evaluation site designed with simplicity and intuitiveness in mind.

## Stack

Courseflow is made with SvelteKit, a powerful all-in-one web framework for creating full stack applications.

Courseflow also uses [Paraglide](https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs/) to provide translation of the site in different languages.
